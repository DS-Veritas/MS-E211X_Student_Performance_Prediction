### Motivation
Evolution in data analyzing technology naturally led to the active analysis of the student performance in educational research. Early prediction of student performance can be helpful for both educators and students. For example, it can allow educators to help students to achieve challenging goals and to take corrective measures for students, who are lagging behind, to mitigate their risk of failure. For this reason, the students’ performance dataset is selected and the research will focus on identifying the significant factors on students’ performance and presenting good models for the prediction. 

### Research Questions
- What are the predictors significantly affecting students’ performance
- How can we predict the student’s academic performance based on these predictors?
- How accurate can we predict the outcome with the regression models? 

### Data Description
The data was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning database. The data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools: Gabriel Pereira HS and Mousinho da Silveira HS. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The questionnaires were answered by 788 students, in total, and 111 answers were discarded due to lack of identification to merge with the mark reports. The data was then integrated into two different datasets: Mathematics (mat) with 395 observations and Portuguese language (por) with 649 observations.
